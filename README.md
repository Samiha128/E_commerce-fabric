## 🚀 Overview
This project aims to analyze ecommerce data to derive insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and inventory management. The data ingestion is performed using ** Data Factory**, and the data is stored in **OneLake**, a data lakehouse solution. Analysis is carried out using SQL, followed by data archiving and visualization in **Power BI**.

### Key Features:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Utilize Fabric Data Factory for efficient data ingestion from various ecommerce sources.
2. **Data Storage**: Store data in OneLake, leveraging its capabilities as a data lakehouse for efficient data management.
3. **Data Analysis**: Perform SQL queries to analyze the data and extract meaningful insights.
4. **Data Visualization**: Use Power BI to create dashboards and reports for better decision-making.

## 🛠️ Installation
To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ecommerce-analysis
    ```

3. Install any required dependencies (if applicable):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up your Azure Data Factory and configure the data ingestion pipeline.

5. Configure your OneLake connection for data storage.

## 🚀 Usage
This project includes SQL scripts and Power BI files for analyzing and visualizing ecommerce data.

### Steps to use the project:

1. **Ingest Data**: Run the data ingestion pipeline in Azure Data Factory to load ecommerce data into OneLake.
2. **Analyze Data**: Use SQL queries to analyze the ingested data in OneLake.
3. **Visualize Data**: Open the Power BI file to visualize the results of your analysis and generate reports.

## 🛠️ Difficulties
- Ensuring smooth data ingestion from various ecommerce platforms.
- Managing data quality and consistency during the ingestion process.
- Efficiently querying large datasets stored in OneLake.
- Designing insightful Power BI dashboards for data visualization.

## 🔧 Points to Improve
